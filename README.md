# Blackjack

Decided to create the card game Blackjack.  
It's at an incomplete state currently as I just started it.  
I decided to post the initial framework.  

Maybe I'll make a log of updates?  

v0.1  
Basic start screen works.  
Play button works and launches a basic gui.  
Bet buttons are implemented but non-functional.  
User controls are implemented but non-functional.  
Deal button is implemented.  
Settings/save file is created.
